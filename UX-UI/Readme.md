### Storyboarding

[Storyboards in website design]((https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/storyboard-website-design/)

## Steps
1. Empathize - relate to the problem you are attempting to solve. Delve deeper into understanding the user and develop solutions that not only meet a need but also significantly improve our users' lives by removing unnecessary discomfort or strife.
2. Define - what to do with all this empathy. Analyze and synthesize observations to define the core problems. Develop a problem statement, such as "As a user, I want to understand the product offering so I can make an informed decision quickly."
3. Ideate - start thinking about ways to solve the problem. Get creative.
4. Prototype - pen on paper, wireframes, rough sketches, or a full-fledged high-fidelity prototype.
5. Test - a real user test the prototype. Observe their actions and try to comprehend and empathize with their choices, and the design cycle continues.
