# Little Lemon Mobile App Table Reservation Feature
## Problem Statement

1. The Challenge: Little Lemon is a popular local restaurant that relies on in-person and phone-based reservations.
   While the restaurant has a mobile application for showcasing its menu and specials, it lacks a seamless,
   integrated system for customers to reserve a table. 
   This absence of a digital reservation feature leads to several pain points:
   * For the **customer**: Customers must call the restaurant during business hours, which is inconvenient and can result
    in long wait times or unanswered calls. They cannot easily check for table availability on their own terms,
    leading to frustration and potentially a lost dining opportunity. The lack of a clear, user-friendly process
    can deter both returning and prospective customers from making reservations.
   * For the **business**: The Little Lemon staff is burdened with managing reservations manually over the phone,
    taking valuable time away from serving in-house diners. Manual scheduling is prone to human error, such as double-booking or missed reservations, which can lead to a negative customer experience. The restaurant is also unable to collect valuable data on customer behavior and reservation trends.

2. The Goal: Design and integrate a new table reservation feature into the existing Little Lemon mobile application.
   This feature will provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way for users to book a table,
   while also offering Little Lemon staff a streamlined system for managing reservations.

3. Key Feature Requirements. The reservation feature must allow customers to:
   * Select a date and time for their reservation.
   * Specify the number of diners in their party.
   * Log in to an existing account or register for a new one using their email.
   * Optionally provide a phone number for reservation confirmations and updates.
   * Receive a confirmation of their reservation within the app.

4. Target Audience. Our primary users are Little Lemon's diverse customer base, including:
   * Returning customers who are already familiar with the restaurant and its menu.
   * Prospective customers who have heard about Little Lemon and are looking for an easy way to book a table for the first time.

5. Success Metrics. The success of this feature will be measured by:
   * Increase in digital reservations: The percentage of total reservations made through the app.
   * User engagement: The number of users who successfully complete the reservation flow.
   * Customer satisfaction: Feedback from user testing and post-launch surveys regarding the ease of use and overall experience.

## Summary

The Little Lemon restaurant is facing a problem with its table reservation process, which currently relies on manual phone calls.
This is inconvenient for customers, who may face long wait times, and inefficient for staff,
who are prone to errors when managing reservations by hand.

To solve this, the goal is to design and add a new table reservation feature to the existing Little Lemon mobile app.
This feature will allow customers to easily select a date, time, and party size. Users will be able to log in
or register to confirm their booking and will receive an in-app confirmation.
The success of this new feature will be measured by an increase in digital reservations and higher customer satisfaction.
