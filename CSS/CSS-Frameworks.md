[Foundation](https://get.foundation)

Foundation is a framework for building user interfaces similar to Bootstrap. 

One prominent feature of Foundation is that it can be used to style content for sending via email.

[Pure.css](https://purecss.io) is designed to be minimal in file size.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework. This means that the framework provides many CSS classes with a single purpose. For example, the CSS class pt-6 sets the padding-top CSS property to 6 pixels. This means that you can be precise in applying styling to your HTML without writing CSS. The advantage to this is that it is more flexible for customizing your webpage's design using the framework. However, the disadvantage is that if multiple developers are working on a project, it could lead to inconsistent design if the team is not strict on its design rules.

[UIKit](https://getuikit.com) is a lightweight CSS framework featuring a small set of responsive components.

[MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp) is a small CSS library that automatically styles HTML elements without needing to apply CSS classes to them. The library aims to allow a developer to quickly prototype a user interface without worrying about the final design, while still being visually appealing. MVP comes from the technical term Minimal Viable Product, a product with sufficient features to demo to customers or other business stakeholders.
