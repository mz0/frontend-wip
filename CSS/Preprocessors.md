* Sass - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. There are two syntaxes available for Sass.
The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) is an extension of the CSS syntax.
This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning.
This syntax is enhanced with Sass features. Files using this syntax have the `.scss` extension.
The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just “Sass”), provides a more concise way of writing CSS.
It uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate the nesting of selectors and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties.
Files using this syntax have the `.sass` extension.
